{"Implementation approach":"We will use the Pygame library to create the user interface and handle game events. Pygame is a popular open-source library for creating games in Python, and it will allow us to create a visually appealing and responsive UI. The game logic will be implemented in a separate module to keep the code organized and maintainable. We will also use the Minimax algorithm for the computer player to ensure a challenging gameplay experience.","File list":["main.py","game.py","ui.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Game {\n        -board: list[list[str]]\n        -current_turn: str\n        +__init__()\n        +make_move(row: int, col: int) bool\n        +check_winner() str\n        +is_draw() bool\n        +reset_game()\n    }\n    class UI {\n        -game: Game\n        +__init__(game: Game)\n        +draw_board()\n        +update_display()\n        +handle_click(position: tuple[int, int])\n        +show_message(message: str)\n    }\n    class Main {\n        -ui: UI\n        +main()\n    }\n    Main --> UI\n    UI --> Game\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant U as UI\n    participant G as Game\n    M->>U: __init__(game)\n    U->>G: __init__()\n    M->>M: main()\n    M->>U: draw_board()\n    U->>G: make_move(row, col)\n    G-->>U: return bool\n    U->>G: check_winner()\n    G-->>U: return str\n    U->>G: is_draw()\n    G-->>U: return bool\n    U->>U: update_display()\n    U->>U: show_message(message)\n    U->>G: reset_game()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarify if there are any specific design themes or color schemes preferred for the UI."}
