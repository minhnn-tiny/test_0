## Requirement Analysis

The requirements focus on creating a basic yet engaging tic-tac-toe game that can be played against another player or the computer. The game should be easy to understand, visually appealing, and provide clear feedback to the player.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement the main game logic for tic-tac-toe']
- ['P0', 'Create a user interface that displays the game board and controls']
- ['P1', 'Add functionality for playing against the computer']
- ['P1', 'Implement a notification system for game results']
- ['P2', 'Design a visually appealing and responsive UI']

## UI Design draft

The UI should include a 3x3 grid representing the game board, with each cell clickable to place a player's mark (X or O). There should be a clear indication of whose turn it is, a button to restart the game, and a notification area to display the game result. The design should be simple, clean, and visually appealing.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarify if there are any specific design themes or color schemes preferred for the UI.
